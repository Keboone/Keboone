Hi I'm Szymon and this is page dedicated for me 

Currently my priority is to work in a position that will allow me to develop my knowledge of programming, mainly in Java.
In addition, I would also like to develop my skills in the broadly understood field of IT, i.e. frontend, backend and computer graphics.

I love cooking, especially dishes combined with chicken. I appreciate an active lifestyle - I practice calisthenics and play football on warmer days.
In addition, I also play computer games. It is true that the school did not encourage me to read books, but after passing my final exams,
I became interested in adventure and self-development books. I am a fan of quiet music, mainly from the genre of Indie,
Alternative Rock, EDM or Deep House and everything that will catch your ear. Recently, I have become very interested in gardening,
especially the art of bonsai, and to de-stress, I fold origami.
